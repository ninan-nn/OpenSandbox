# Example Kubernetes Runtime Configuration for OpenSandbox Server
#
# This configuration file demonstrates how to configure the OpenSandbox server
# to use Kubernetes as the sandbox runtime.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to ~/.sandbox.toml (or set SANDBOX_CONFIG_PATH environment variable)
#   2. Update the configuration values according to your environment
#   3. Start the server: uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
log_level = "INFO"
# api_key = "your-secret-api-key"  # Optional: Uncomment to enable API key authentication

[runtime]
type = "kubernetes"
execd_image = "opensandbox/execd:latest"

[kubernetes]
# Path to kubeconfig file. Leave as null to use in-cluster configuration
# Replace with your path
kubeconfig_path = "~/.kube/config"

# Namespace for sandbox workloads
namespace = "opensandbox"

# Workload provider type: available providers are registered in the provider factory
# If not specified, uses the first registered provider (typically "batchsandbox")
workload_provider = "batchsandbox"

# Path to the BatchSandbox template file
# Replace with your path
batchsandbox_template_file = "~/batchsandbox-template.yaml"
